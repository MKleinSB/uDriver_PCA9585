===MicroDriver PCA9685===
Design Specificiation

[ABOUT]
PCA9685 Driver for the MicroBit in the form of a library/makecode package.

[DESIGN]
Commication with the PCA9685 is done via i2c, All PCA9685 respond to thef
i2c address 0xE0, hence unless given otherwise, that address would be the 
default address used for communication with the PCA9685. 

The PCA9685 uses a control register to address the rest of its many registers
when writing to the PCA9685, the first byte  written to the PCA9685 would go
into the control register, which would select which register the rest of the
data goes to.

Exposed API
-----
analog_write(pin, %duty_cycle) - write % duty cycle to the pin on the PCA9685
select_address(i2c_addr) - select the i2c address to use whenn talking to PCA9685

--Advanced--
set_pwm_frequency(hertz) - set PWM modulation frequency
sleep_mode(microseconds) - activate sleep mode on the PCA9685 for given 
                            microseconds

Internals
-----
pwm_write(pin, value) - write PWM value 0 to 4095.
register_read(reg) - read value from register.
register_write(reg, value) - write value to register
